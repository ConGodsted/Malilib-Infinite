malilib
==============
malilib is a library mod used by masa's LiteLoader mods. It contains some common code previously
duplicated in most of the mods, such as multi-key capable keybinds, configuration GUIs etc.

This version is an unofficial fork compiled for use in 20w14infinite and the Simply Infinite modpack. 
For compiled builds (= downloads), see https://github.com/ConGodsted/Malilib-Infinite/releases

Compiling
=========
Compiling isn't as straightforward as with the official release, as official versions of Mod Menu aren't available on its maven.
In order to compile this version, you'll need to supply local versions of these files.
